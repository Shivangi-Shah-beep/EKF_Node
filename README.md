Ongoing: EKF-Based Vision Localization for Mobile Robots
Currently fine-tuning covariance parameters to improve localization accuracy.

Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for landmark-based localization using vision-based measurements in a robotic system.

Key Features
Developed an EKF-based localization algorithm to enhance robot state estimation.
Implemented camera-based feature extraction, measurement models, and state estimation in ROS.
Integrated LiDAR and odometry data for improved motion prediction and sensor fusion.
Designed and optimized the measurement model and Jacobian derivation using SymPy.
